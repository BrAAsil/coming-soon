## Contribute

If you find a bug, please visit the [Project Issues](https://github.com/BrAAsil/coming-soon/issues) and create a ticket. Please search to see if there is a similar ticket already in there before creating a new one.

When creating a ticket, clearly explain:

- What you were trying to do.
- What you expected to happen.
- What actually happened.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.

Also include any information you think is relevant to reproducing the problem such as the browser used, does it happen in a different version and so on. An image also works wonders.

Remember that the more information you give, the faster the issue can be solved.

## Submit a patch

Before starting work on a feature/issue, either create a ticket or comment on an existing ticket to ensure that we're all communicating.

To contribute to the project, make sure to read the [Dev Workflow](docs/dev-workflow.md). Follow it to the letter.
