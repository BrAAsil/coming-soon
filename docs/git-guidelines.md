# Git Guidelines

1. Never push commits directly to any mainline branches
1. Always create a topic branch for your active development
1. Commit early and commit often
1. Commit only related work
Push your changes to the server **at least once a day**
1. Adequately configure the commit authorship (eg. configure your user name and email)
1. Rebase your working branch frequently
1. Write descriptive and meaningful commit messages
1. Commit messages **MUST** follow [these rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
1. On v2 we will follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), so get cozy with it.
